# Online_Shopper_Purchase_Intention

● Preprocessed consumer data of an e-commerce website having 10000+ entries using dimensionality reduction and selected relevant features using chi square test and correlation plots; used SMOTE for balancing highly imbalanced data to predict purchase of a customer

● Generated visualizations in python to study relations between features in order to consider them for further analysis

● Developed libraries for Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naïve Bayes and Neural Network models from scratch to predict customer purchase intention (0/1) and selected Neural Network with highest sensitivity and accuracy of 90%

● Implemented a cutoff vs sensitivity/accuracy analysis to allow stakeholders to control cutoff for a better result on selected metrics where cutoff of 0.4 gave optimal results
